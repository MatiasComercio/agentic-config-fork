# GitHub PR Review

Review the GitHub pull request with comprehensive validation using multi-agent orchestration.

## Inputs

- **PR_LINK**: $1 (GitHub PR URL, e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123`)
- **EXPECTED_CHANGES**: $2 (Brief description of expected changes)
- **REPORT_PATH**: $3 (Optional; defaults to `outputs/pr_reviews/`)

---

## Pre-Flight

1. Extract PR number from URL: `$1`
2. Generate UUID for this review session
3. Create output directory: `outputs/orc/{date}-{uuid}/`

---

## Step 1: Fetch PR Data

Use `gh` CLI to gather PR information:

```
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json title,body,author,state,baseRefName,headRefName,files,additions,deletions,commits
gh pr diff <PR_NUMBER>
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json comments,reviews
gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER>
```

Store PR metadata for agent context.

---

## Step 2: Launch Review Agents (PARALLEL)

Use the **Task tool** to spawn 5 agents in parallel. Each agent writes findings to its output file.

### Agent 1: Expected Changes Validation
**Subagent type**: `general-purpose`
**Task**: Compare PR diff against expected changes: `$2`
- Identify missing expected changes
- Identify unexpected/out-of-scope changes
- Report alignment score (1-10) and gaps
- Write summary to: `{OUTPUT_DIR}/01_expected_changes.md`

### Agent 2: Security Review
**Subagent type**: `general-purpose`
**Task**: Security review of PR diff
- Check for hardcoded secrets/credentials
- Check for SQL injection, command injection, XSS vulnerabilities
- Check for insecure dependencies
- Check for permission/auth issues
- Reference OWASP Top 10
- Write summary to: `{OUTPUT_DIR}/02_security.md`

### Agent 3: Code Quality Review
**Subagent type**: `general-purpose`
**Task**: Code quality review of PR diff
- Validate against project conventions (if documented)
- RUN project-configured linters and type checkers on changed files from PR diff
- REPORT any NEW violations introduced by this PR (ignore pre-existing issues)
- REPORT any pre-commit hook failures with remediation guidance (if hooks are configured)
- Check type annotations present and correct
- Check error handling (re-raise, no silent failures)
- Check function complexity and readability
- Check naming conventions and import organization
- Write summary to: `{OUTPUT_DIR}/03_code_quality.md`

### Agent 4: Test Discovery & Execution
**Subagent type**: `general-purpose`
**Task**: Discover and run tests from PR
- Find test files in diff
- Find CLI configurations (test.json, cli.py patterns)
- Execute discovered tests with pytest
- Report pass/fail with output
- Write summary to: `{OUTPUT_DIR}/04_tests.md`

### Agent 5: Logic & Bug Risk Analysis (CRITICAL)
**Subagent type**: `general-purpose`
**Model**: `opus` (requires deep reasoning)
**Task**: Critical evaluation of logic changes and bug introduction risk

#### Logic Correctness Review
- **Intent vs Implementation**: Does the code actually achieve what it's supposed to?
- **Edge Cases**: Identify unhandled edge cases (nulls, empty collections, boundary values)
- **State Management**: Check for race conditions, stale state, improper state transitions
- **Control Flow**: Verify branching logic, loop terminations, early returns are correct
- **Data Flow**: Trace data through the change - are transformations correct?

#### Bug Introduction Risk
- **Behavioral Regressions**: Changes that might break existing functionality
- **Silent Failures**: Paths where errors could be swallowed or ignored
- **Type Coercion Issues**: Implicit conversions that might lose data or precision
- **Off-by-One Errors**: Index/range calculations
- **Null Reference Risks**: Accessing properties on potentially null/undefined values
- **Resource Leaks**: Unclosed connections, file handles, memory allocations

#### Logic Smell Detection
- **Inverted Conditions**: Logic that does the opposite of what variable names suggest
- **Dead Code Paths**: Unreachable branches introduced by the change
- **Contradictory Logic**: Conditions that can never be true together
- **Missing Validation**: Input assumptions not validated
- **Inconsistent Handling**: Similar cases handled differently without reason

#### Impact Analysis
- **Downstream Effects**: What other components rely on changed code?
- **Contract Violations**: Does the change break implicit contracts with callers?
- **Assumption Changes**: Are assumptions about data/state still valid?

#### Output Format
For each issue found:
```
[SEVERITY] - [Category]
Location: file:line
Issue: [description]
Why it's a bug: [reasoning]
Fix suggestion: [if applicable]
```

- Write summary to: `{OUTPUT_DIR}/05_logic_bugs.md`

---

## Step 3: Aggregate Results

After ALL agents complete:
1. Read all agent summaries from `{OUTPUT_DIR}/*.md`
2. Synthesize findings into consolidated report

---

## Step 4: Generate Review Report

Create report at: `$3` or `outputs/pr_reviews/PR-{PR_NUMBER}-{UUID}.md`

### Report Template

```markdown
# PR Review: #{PR_NUMBER}

**URL**: {PR_URL}
**Title**: {PR_TITLE}
**Author**: {AUTHOR}
**Branch**: {HEAD} -> {BASE}
**Review Session**: {UUID}
**Date**: {TIMESTAMP}
