Migrate manual agentic installation using the agentic-migrate agent.

Target directory: ${1:-.}

The agent will:
1. Detect existing manual installation
2. Identify customizations to preserve
3. Explain migration process
4. Create backup of existing files
5. Convert to centralized management
6. Guide manual merge of custom content
7. Offer to commit migration changes

Use this to convert projects with manually-installed agentic configurations to the centralized system.
